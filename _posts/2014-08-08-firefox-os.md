Long and interesting story of a project that ended up as a firefox OS. Probably
it's only a part of the full picture, because author only talks about building
browser for the system, but it's still very interesting who it all went from
a few men project with a quick and dirty prototype to a fully featured browser
that will later integrate with the system almost entirely to diminish the borders
between apps and websites.

The story is interesting also in sense that the development happens really around
the world from Paris to San Francisco and Tai Pei which reminds my somehow the
novels of Neal Stevenson.

The other thing worth looking at is a number of improvements that was made in Gecko
in order to make it possible to beal fully featured browser web app.
