Third NYTimes article in a day. This one deals with the question of one's happiness, no more no less. One statement is that it's not only happiness and unhappiness, it's happiness and all shades of unhapiness. Fame, money, sex even make the person more unhappy than he was before, and it's not the right way to go if the only thing you want to achieve is a happy life. Author states, that all these things work more as adrenaline than a cause for happiness, the more you get it the more you needed the less happy you are. And the only way to avoid this trap is to stop trying to reach happiness though this things.
