I decided to write down my own thoughts and conclusions from the
course "Learning how to learn" as a final project. My own part will
represent some ideas that I have and that provide more context to
the course on my opinion. Also I will try to end up with somewhat
working and consistant plan for learning something new.

First of all, the motivation part. Why do we learn? What do we learn?
This term has a very broad definition and it's very easy to end up
learning lot's of things of very little importance or use for us. The world
around us is fascinating and there are tons of things that are worth
knowing. In reality the number of these areas is even bigger
and every learning subject hides lots of books, videos and courses
behind it. You can take photography, drawing, biology, artificial
intelligence - any field you can imagine, and it will be really huge
and can be split into smaller independent pieces that are huge on itself.
When we learn we're trying to make ourselves better in this sense or
another and it's very easy to start learning everything at once and
it's obvious that the possibility of learning everything at once is
much lower than in situation when you have only one subject that you
can master. So, failure is very much possible and this might bring
the illusion that the ability to learn has vanished and basically nothing
new finds its way into the head, which is just not true.

As was stated in the course we all have two types of memory - shortterm
and longterm one, and what happens is that we place some initial knowledge
into the shortterm memory and then switch to another subject which will
mostly replace the previous one with new information. The solution is to
have a focus and it's very important on my opinion. The focus in this
situation is an ability to prioritize items that you want to learn and
prevent yourself to learn anything that is not a top priority.

How to get the focus? The most important thing on my opinion is to have
an idea what exactly do you want to reach at the end or at least to know
the direction where you want to go. To have the goal
or to feel the meaning is important in all areas of life, but it's really
important in learning, because it will help to structure studies and
to define a roadmap for future.

These are the most important things that I want to add on my own. If
we talk about individual courses or books that are to be mastered I would
like to introduce my own favorite set of ideas from the course, that
I treat as very important.

The two most important concepts that I got from the book are chunking
and the notion of long and shortterm memory. These terms are not actionable
by themselves but different methods described in the course help use one
concept or another.

- Chunking is  is a process of forming self-contained bundles
out of any ideas and terms so that they can be used on their own in different
context without figuring out all underlying details every time.
- Shortterm memory is the part of our memory where we hold the information
that we found out right now and we can easily forget.
- Longterm memory is the general storage of our knowledge. All things that
we know very well end up in this type of memory.

So the process of learning from my understanding is a continuous process
of forming chunks and putting them in the longterm memory where we can use it.

Which of the methods shown in the course are most helpful on my opinion and
from my experience? I would say that they are *practice, (self)explanation
and the ability to switch off*.

First of all, *practice*. The fact we understand something doesn't necesary
mean that we know it or can do it. Most of the times our understanding
is superficial or doesn't take into account all aspects of reality, but
that matters a lot and not only for learning new subject but also for
using it in real life. I would take the example that is closest to me
at the moment. When we talk about algorythms in robotics there are lots
of layers in them. You can learn high level planning solutions, but if
you try to implement them, you will find that they do not just work by
themselves, there are several layers below them, each closer to the
hardware than the previous one. On the top level you can produce
command *clean(floor)*, but level below there is a whole new set of
problems that include navigation on the middle level and actual interaction
with the hardware on the level below that, and the complexity of the
subjects is not evident when looking on the topmost algorythms. Given that
the practice does not only allow to get the ideas from the shortterm memory
to a longterm one, it also provides lots of valuable insights of how
this idea interacts with others and can probably suggest the next steps
in the studies and maybe even can influence on future projects that you
may have.

With all these properies practice is helpful in conquering both chunking
and putting subject in a longterm memory for later wild use. Practice really
helps to get the feeling of the constraints, limitations and dependencies of
the ideas. The important point is that not every type of practice is helpful.
It's very easy to solve simple problems but only finding solutions to difficult
ones makes us smarter.

The second important part for me is (self)explanation. I would say that
it's a somewhat natural part of practicing.

The third important part is the ability to switch off.

If we have a strong goal that we want to reach, we can get a feeling that the
closest way to do it is to devote as much time as possible to it. There was a
lot of attention in the course to the diffuse mode and focused mode, and the
thing is that you can still learn a lot in diffuse mode because the brain is
processing information in the background even if you think that you're just
waisting you time doing nothing. What I found really helpful and that was
verified by several people in the course is that an ability to switch from the
current topic to something different and not relevant really helps. It can be
as simple as sitting in the sofa and watching tv, but it can also be a physical
exerices and I find them even more helpful because with them you can still gain
a lot. You can take any sport - swimming, running, maybe martial arts. It will
be a very different exercise for your brain and I do believe that we can benefit
a lot from doing different things. Besides allowing as to grow in several directions
it also allow to fill the progress in different things you're doing and that
helps to keep the motivation on the higher level.

And here I want to dwell a bit on the procrastination.


Thanks for your attention.
