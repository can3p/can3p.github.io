## Intro

Do you remember good old nineties? It was a time when websites looked, well,
like a mess on today's standards and browsers were not really helping with
that. You could make a career on being able to craft round corners that looked
ok on netscape, opera and internet explorer, becase it wasn't trivial at all.

What happened next was a huge movement that gave us all the web standards we
love and use today. It was also the time of pixel perfect design.  I still
remember how I would alt-tab between the browser window and photoshop or use an
exported png as a background in order to fulfill designer's expectations.

Not only that, we were all busy crafting our home pages, making them look
unique and awesome. Or take MySpace or Livejournal.com where you could make
your joural unique by adjusting the templates.

That was an era full of creativity but then it was gone and what's interesting
many people haven't noticed.

## Facebook

Disclaimer - I was a livejournal.com engineer back in the days. It's hard to
overestimate how much users cared about their styles. Every time some change
had to be introduced (like fb like button) we had to carefully craft it in all
the different designs that were supported by the system, help out popular blogs
that had their own custom styles and still got it wrong once in a while.

The same users who hated us for any changes on their beloved blogs and
eventually switched to facebook and other huge platforms that are there now
didn't care a single bit about the fact that they had near zero level of
control on the presentation there. As it turned out, if the content is good
and all your friends are around you don't need that much. And facebook is
actually not extreme in this situation, you can craft your post in markdown,
other platforms don't give users almost any way to control the layout and
everyone is just fine with it.

Instagram users can only write plaintext without any formatting and it even
doesn't look nice on the phone and you have to insert an image even in case you
only want to post a message and you know what? Nobody cares. I can only talk
about russian speaking segment of the platform but the amount of activity there
is just crazy. People not only share cat photos there, but also buy and sell
stuff, write analytical articles, do workshops and trainings without any
problem. The fact that sometimes they have to literally edit the photo and put
a text overlay on top of it (and it often looks like some of the worst myspace
examples) doesn't bother anyone. And all the communication is solved with a
restricted instagram account or a closed whatsapp group.

Or take twitter. Before we got threads some users posted images with the text
to work around text limitation. That's crazy, you cannot even copy/paste or
quote this thing. And no one cared. As it turns out, the main reason people
are on the internet is social interactions and if the design is good enough
and, most importantly, others can discover your content, the rest simply does
not matter.

Do you remember how your friend's website looks like? You don't probably,
because it actually doesn't matter that much. But you probably do remember some
catchy text they wrote. I'm a huge fan of Dan Luu's blog and eventhough it's
literally just html in it's simplest form, just try to open [one][1] of his
posts in the reader mode in firefox and you'll find out that it looks awesome
with zero bloat you usually get. It doesn't even use react!

Same goes for your favorite rss reader where all articles look nice even if the
author haven't done anything about it. You can go to github and open a file
with this very post and it will render just fine for you, zero html involved
from my side.

## HTML

Now let's discuss, what unites social platforms, rss readers and firefox reader
mode.

If you compare all of them you will see that they all do not support any of the
complex markup of html or formatting of the css. In most cases users cannot
even chose where to put the images, it's all decided by the platform.

If you think about it all the platforms have become real browsers within a
browser and what makes them so effective is specifically that the users are
limited in the way the present content. Why so? Because simple markup makes it
trivial to render the content anywhere ranging from a desktop browser to a
fridge.  Not just that, it's absolutely up to platforms how to render the
content in the first place. The photos are at the bottom now, but they can as
well be put anywhere else, page previews can be generated and a whole lot of
other stuff that would simply not possible if the constraints were not there.
It's also important to note again that users usually don't care too much about
the presentation of the information on the platform if it reaches their
audience, because this is the only point.

If you still have any doubts, take Gemini proctocol as an example. The
[list][2] of clients on the project page suggests that eventhough building a
proper web browser is no small task, the rendering part of it is definitely
trivial especially if you compare it to let's say a multiyear effort by
Serenity OS community to get ther web browser to a proper level. They're doing
wonders really, but the complexity and scale of specs and the variety of real
world use cases requires a tremendeous amount of work to get it right to an
extent that even bigger players like Microsoft and Opera have given up on
supporting their own rendering engines.

Another angle to take is that there is another problem that's being discussed
every now and then - as time goes by, the web is not getting any faster. We
get better connection only to get more bloated websites as a result. A basic
website can deliver megabytes and megabytes of styles and scripts just
because an unlucky dependency made webpack to include a half of npm registry
into the build. You can fight against it, but that's really an uphill battle,
everything is designed in a way to make including more stuff simpler, not
the opposite. The CSS design is fundamentally hostile to any cleanups, which
most people who tried to remove a `div p a` selector from the code base
would agree with.

Just to make the final point: none of the dialects used by the platforms is
standardised. Markdown has a standard, but except from really basic stuff that
covers suprisingly big amount of cases, the rest is not really well supported
every where and again that doesn't bother too many people.

## Full circle

To summarise, here is what's important:

- A decent (not perfect) way to render content with some simple formatting
- Discovery
- Community
- Some way to do payments that does not necesserily have to be integrated into
  a platform

What's not that important is a unique ux for your website, far from it. The
only hard requirement is for your website to look decent on mobile and given
the examples above it doesn't necesserily require any complex styling or
markup.

What if we've put standards in a wrong place? What if modern css and js mess is
just a big mistake? It took a lot to get the capabilities that would make web
apps usable and it's not trivial still in addition to giving no guarantee from
providing a crappy experience to the user.

Just imagine a browser being a much fatter client, where the end websites
have a very limited way of controlling the presentation because it's all
handled by the browser. All the discussions about semantic markup that
were there ten years ago would get their actual meaning, since this
information would be required for browsers to render the pages correctly.

If you go in that direction, html ceases to be holy and can be replaced in
favor of simpler language with better spec. You can already see it working
quite well with Figma which is a world class design app which absolutely
ignores html and the rest. But you can go even further by integrating payments
into the browsers and making a custom protocol that would allow to pay for the
posts or services and even totally giving away control on the presenation layer
to them (or users) and even making custom content types per use case as long as
browsers can render them somehow.

Giving design decisions to the browsers was historically a bad idea (just
look at the confirm prompts or calendar widget for the input[type=date] that
doesn't look good no matter what), and that's a problem, however simpler
markup languages and alternative content types could open up a new market
for the new apps that would compete to render them the best.
