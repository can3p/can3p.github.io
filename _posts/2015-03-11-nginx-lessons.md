Article tells the story of Netflix's approach to the development process and deployment.
There are some really good parts like making assumtions explicit and validating them
from time to time. From my own experience I've seen that kind of things multiple time.
Organizations get bigger, people get older care more about vacations and overall
stability and care less about company future or new technologies at all.

I cannot really judge the part about using cloud solutions everywhere, but continuous
delivery process and independent serivces, that are somewhat easy to deploy is what
I experience now and I don't want to go back.
