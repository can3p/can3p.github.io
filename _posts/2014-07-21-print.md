Another article that pokes around the question that print media becomes more the part of the past. It cannot compete with social networks in terms of reaction on events, because new tweets and videos go online almost immediately. The interesting thing that is mentioned by author is that Internet provides different style of reading than print. With internet you just can get enough and always switch to the new content. As a consequence, one can hardly remember the information that he got from all the links he has read today. Probably, it's not needed, but what is the reason for reading it anyway?
