Another amazing article by James Longster, that continues his series of blog post about
web development from future, where he speaks about all kinds of features, techniques and
new abilities of Javascript language that completely change the way how we can deal with
common problems during the development.

One of the problems is constant dealing with events, wich leads to rather complicated
code that balances between different events by containing intermediate state somewhere
and the more complex interaction gets the more complex code we get. Another source of
asynchronous complexity is actual async part which comes from any ajaxy activity.

Js-csp is a neat way of dealing with all these two issues in a uniform way. The way it
unified if that all the differences are abstracted away by channels where any value
can be put in and read from. The key difference, that these operations are **blocking**
with proper try/catch support etc. Hence you get several blocking blocks of code that
actually only block themselves and communicate via channel messages.
