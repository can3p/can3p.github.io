IBM has just presented the computer chip with the fundamentally new architecture
that is really different from Von Neuman arctitecture in all the ways. It's
still built with transistors but at the end it's a hardware made neural network,
where these transistors work as perceptrons or synapses.

On the tech demo it was demonstrated that such a chip can do image recognition
from a live video stream with a very little energy consumed and at the same time
the decent notebook could only deal with 10 times slow video stream and consumed
10,000 more power.

Since it's a neural network it requires very specific programming. It has not distinct
processor and memory, because such network does both. And to program it correctly
it's required to program how parts blocks of the chip should be interconnected and
how much influence they will have on each other. And then one should run the code
in the chip simulator and only after that the code could be run on chip.

So the chip is really great in terms of future potential but provides a very big
challenge in terms of programming because it's so different from anything else.
