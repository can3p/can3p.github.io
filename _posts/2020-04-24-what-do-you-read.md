There are some habits that I developed during my life
that sometimes give me pure moments of joy. The reason
that happens is mostly due to the fact that I don't
know exactly what I get and I don't do it to achieve
something, it's plain curiosity.

One of them is browsing maps. Earlier that were paper
maps. now it's Google Maps but the principle stays the
same - I just scroll through the map in any direction
and sometimes find some interesting stuff (like this
[circular house](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Round_house1.jpg)
in Moscow).

Another one is reading signs or just looking around
at cars and buildings. Here is [one](https://www.deepbv.nl/)
of my recent findings. How cool is that?

Or here is one more - whenever I see someone reading
a book I immediately start googling the name and
in many cases I end up reading something [fascinating
and new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagues_and_Peoples)
to me.

What unites all of this is pure randomness of the process -
you don't know what you get. It can be total crap, it
can be a pearl, you don't know and this is the essence.

Anyone can name lot's of random events that turned life
upside down and that was the best thing happened to them.
Moreover, in many cases it's completely fair to say that
random events played a far more important role that
any specific plans.

What also unites all this pure randomness is that it's
impossible to optimize for, conversion is too low. Amazon
or Spotify will be able to give you most relevant _similar_
items to what you already have, but noone will be able
to recommend you something that you don't know you like,
it's always a bubble of some sorts.

It's completely fine to be in such bubbles, since the
experience is predictable and enjoyable, but
you can already feel that you're missing out and you
don't know what. Every single time randomeness disappears
in one or the other area we gain something but at the
same time we lose.

The closest to my heart is of course books. Since it's
all the smarphones and e-readers now, you cannot really
say what people read, and that's tragic, because some
of them can read a book that will change one's life. And
no one will ask.

What I think would be really cool is to reverse this trend.
Let every e-reader or smartphone to publish information
via bluetooth to nearby devices. There is no point in
that except feeding curiosity of others, but that already
sounds fascinating, right? To do something for no reason,
except letting others to experience a pure joy of randomness.
