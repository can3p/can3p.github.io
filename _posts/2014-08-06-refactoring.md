Talk that is interesting only because it's an example of attempt to somehow compare
expressiveness of three JVM languages - Java, Scala and Clojure. Author represents
a simple problem with solutions on all languages and then modifies the problem to
show how different languages can easily adopt to them.

Author shows that Java solution is always bigger in terms of LoC
and requires the developer to work more on the type definitions than on solution
of the problem. The thing is that problem described in the talk is a toy one, so
it has nothing to do with real big systems and gives only feel of how it can be
in different languages. The other fact that decreases the value of the talk is
that at the end author says that although java looks very verbose and awkward
comparing to two other languages he still use it the most and will continue to
do it for any real projects in future. Given that there is a doubt that he really
believes in what he is talking about.
