A presentation about real-life experience with Haskell development. The language
is more than 20 years old but still the real applications of the language are
rather rare, so such links may be very useful.

I don't know a lot about language itself, so some of the slides are rather cryptic
to me, but interesting parts are athe beginning where the overview of the literature
is and the end of the presentations where one can find general suggestions about
how to sturcture the haskell development if you want to do it.

May be worth looking again in some future where I and Haskell will meet together.
