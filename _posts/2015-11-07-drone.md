This summer I saw some videos with FPV races that were so awesome that I decided
that I want build my own drone for racing.

The least straightforward part was to actually select parts to build from. If
you have no experience in hobby electronics you will be amazed by amount of
what's available on the market. There are all sorts of different frames, motors,
distribution boards etc. And if you start choosing something while you're still
not sure about essential list of parts you'll encounter a whole lot of
additional options: what about led lights? If so, what kind of lights,
whaterproof or not? What about onboard HD camera? And so on. All this questions
take time to check compatability, voltage, connectors and other options
available.

After a while I understood that the best way might be to go with bare minimum
required to make drone that flies and iterate on it. There is [awesome
series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jbpwqCCVbs) of tutorial videos on the
topic that cover all building process with just a few parts that you might want
to do differently and it was vital for the success of my build.

Now, here is the list of the details that I used. I've split them in a sections
with bare minimum on top and additional options below.

## Parts list

Required parts:

- [H250 ZMR250 250mm Carbon Fiber](http://www.banggood.com/H250-ZMR250-250mm-Carbon-Fiber-Mini-Quadcopter-Multicopter-Frame-Kit-p-933185.html)

  board](http://www.banggood.com/Distribution-Board-ESC-Hub-For-QAV250-KIM250-250Pro-Frame-p-948634.html)
  Any board will do, this was not the best one. Actually, there are
  [options](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=23140)
  that allow make everything without soldering at all, because they already have
  XT60 male plug soldered in and bullet plugs for ESCs.
- [XT60 Male Plug
  12AWG](http://www.banggood.com/XT60-Male-Plug-10AWG-10cm-With-Wire-p-77537.html) In case you bought a distribution board that requires soldering
- [Tie Down Strap for 11.1 3S 2200

- [AfroFlight Naze32 Acro AbuseMark FunFly Controller - Soldered version](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=68813)
- [DYS BE1806-13 Brushless Motor for Multirotor (2300KV) 24g](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=61433)

- [Polyester Velcro Peel-n-stick adhesive side V-STRONG](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=9374)

FPV gear. If you want to start from bare minimum this is totally not required.

- [Skyzone Plug & Play FPV 500-Set With TS58500 TX, RC832 RX, Sony 700CCD and C/P Antennas](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=66474)

Expendables:

- [Turnigy 2200mAh 3S 25c](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=8934) I bought this one, but it's rather heavy and maybe an overkill for the start
- [HobbyKing® B3AC Compact Charger](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=22410)
- [Gemfan 5x3 5030 Propeller 250 Frame](http://www.banggood.com/Gemfan-5x3-Inch-Plastic-5030-Propeller-CWCCW-For-240-250-Frame-p-937866.html)
  Probably you might want to buy lots of these


Misc stuff:

  Update](http://www.banggood.com/FlySky-Data-Cable-USB-Download-Line-For-FS-i6-FS-T6-Transmitter-Firmware-Update-p-982289.html) The cable should enable you to use the transmitter for firmware update and for using it with simulators.


## A few notes about how I chose parts.

The ideal way was to go throught every part
that might be necessary and look for best options, but after a week of long
evening spent by googling stuff and reading forums I decided that this strategy
wil not lead me anywhere. So, checked several tutorials and selected the most
popular cheap frame and combination of ESCs and motors that sort of made sense.
I didn't do any calculations about the load these motors can lift, so it was a
total guess.

FPV gear was chosen because it was a) cheap and b) literally plug n play. Maybe
Quanum DIY FPV goggleset will not give the best video ever but it does the job
and you can really forget about FPV parts or order them later if you're just
making your first training flights.

Velcro tape is super useful to attach anything to anything. Accumulators,
cameras - everything that should be detachable will benefit from it, because it
is really sticky and connects parts well.

Propeller. There are different modifications of propellers but 5x3 should be the
mildest option.

Accumulators. If you're without FPV gear two accumulators should be more than
enough for you and their capacity can be smaller and hence save space. And one
charger is enough! If you'll take the same transmitter like I did you can try to
adopt one more accumulator to be inside of it, you can check tutorials on the
net.

## Assembling process

The assembling process was more or less straightforward and you can follow video
tutorial I mentioned earlier. For me the main difference with tutorial was usage
of power distribution board and actual setup of the controller. None of them are
really hard especially if you're comfortable with soldering.

For flight controller I used Cleanflight firmware and it's easy enough to setup.

## Few difficulties.

Radio reciever requires input voltage of 5V and I didn't have a 2 cell
accumulator. The solution was to actually plug naze32 board and use it as power
source.

The other issue was with receiver was that when I started plugging wires between
receiver and controller I couldn't make it right before I stopped makeing the
assumptions that channels on the receiver match channels on controller. In my
cases channels like 5-6 were mixed.

## Result

It was really fun and I'm eager to start studying how to fly drone better and
there is also a lot of autopilot staff that I want to adress.
