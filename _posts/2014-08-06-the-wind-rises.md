Animation film by Hayao Miyadzaki. Film is absolutely perfect
if you think about it without historical context of that time
and I would highly recommend to watch it carefully instead of
reading another one big article about how to fight ro live with
procrastination.

The main figure, Jiro Horikoshi dreams about planes all his
childhood and spends all his animated life by creating them and
devotes all his time to his dream. His desire to build the
perfect plane is so high that when he gets the mission to build
a war plane he thinks more of how to build it than on the fact
that Japan is going to attack surrounding contries to expand
it's influence. Or probably he approves these actions, but
I think that Miyadzaki purposely omitted this in the movie.

If we will put the war away from the story then at the end
we get a story of a man who loves his job to death who dreams
about it even when he doesn't work. And who loves his wife
but even given that she's very ill he can get from his obsession
with planes and spend a bit more time with her.

And it's the situation that make the film so magnicient to me. Jiro
works on his plane even when she comes to him to spend her last
days with him. The illness is on the final stage and what happens
is that he just accepts this fact and continues to work on his
plane. His wife Nahokoalso accepts this but also accepts the
fact the even these days Jiro spends most of his time pursuing
his dream. We even see that they both see the pain of all this,
but he doesn't stop working even through the tears.

The movie reminds me the life of such people as Sergey Korolev
who work to make their dream come true and even big struggles
cannot stop them from doing it.
