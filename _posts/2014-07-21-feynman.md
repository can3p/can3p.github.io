The letter Richard Feynman wrote to one of his graduates to explain that it's worth to work no only with world-scale problems but with all problems that you are capable solving of. If you're not noticed by most of the world, you're still known and loved and recognized amongst friends, relatives and colleages and you can always do something about that. Probably it's worth to print this letter and to hang it on the wall in my room. The stie is worth additional exploration
