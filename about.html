<p>Hi, my name is Dmitry Petrov, I live in Amsterdam, Netherlands and work at Booking.com as a Fullstack developer.</p>
<p>I mostly do web services for living and all kinds of small projects not specifically related to web in my spare time.
I do <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Lisp-Scheme-Meetup/">Amsterdam Lisp &amp; Scheme meetup</a> from time to time.</p>
<p>If you're in Amsterdam area and want to talk about lisp, hacking things or let me know about interesting
and complex project you're working on, feel free to <a href="mailto:dpetroff@gmail.com">drop me a mail</a>.</p>
