Hi, my name is Dmitry (Dima) Petrov, I live in Amsterdam, Netherlands and work at REKKI as a developer.

I mostly do web services for living and all kinds of small projects not specifically related to web in my spare time.

If you're in Amsterdam area and want to talk about lisp, hacking things or let me know about an interesting
project you're working on, feel free to <a href="mailto:dpetroff@gmail.com">drop me a mail</a>.
