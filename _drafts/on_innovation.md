## Intro

If you get into a new house it's often not comfortable from
day one. The lights are turned on from a weird place, a kitchen
sink doesn't make any sense, the sofa stands in the way to surely
kill you. However with time everyone gets used to the environment
and can dance around this sofa in total darkness or turn the light
by throwing a pillow. The reason there is that our brain automates
most of the decisions and processes in the background the information
that used to be processed actively.

The choice is hard anywhere you look. I can't stand coffeeshops
where you need to fill in a questionaire before you get you coffee.
Here or take-away? Big or small? Normal milk? With foam or not?

This is precisely what makes product development really hard - it's
all about decisions that have no obvious validation right away.
Every building block you add represents a new set of possibilities
that may or may not take off and you need to navigate this somehow.

Can big companies do that? I'd say no, not really. For a big majority
of big corps they end up milking their cash cow till the very end
and very few of them come up with another killer product. You can
take the biggest ones - amazon, google, facebook. Out of three only
amazon managed to do a breakthrough with aws. Google and facebook
mostly acquired companies and somehow managed not to kill them. Out
of these two google is particularly notorious at building new products
only to kill them relatively shortly after.

To understand why it's the case I'll steal the idea from Innovator's
Dillema book. New products require dedication, however in any of the
big companies new product will represent a revenue closer to the
error margin than anything else. Any sane manager would do tasks
for the existing product in the first place since that's where the bonuses
and promotions are. If you combine it with "we know ho to do it right" (c)
approach where a product with 0 users has to be hosted in several dcs
be fault tolerant and what not the eventual failure is almost inevitable.
